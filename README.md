# Implementing the OMDB API Using Nodejs

This is a cool little project we were challenged to figure out in the NYCDA Part Time Evening FullStack JS Intensive class yesterday by our teacher. I first attempted in school with no success, and then continued when I got home. It took a little while to wrap my head around it, but I finally did. When I started thinking in terms of React, it made more sense!

As there would be with **React**, there are essentially two parts to this little movie scraping app.

First, however, before I did anything else, I had to require the `request` **npm package** at the top of the file, and the built in `http` node module:

```
const request = require('request');
const http = require('http');
```

the `http` **node module** enables access to a `localhost/dev server` on a computer. The interface is careful to never buffer entire requests or responses, so the user is able to stream data. The `request` **npm package** is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls. It supports **HTTPS** and follows redirects by default.

Next, there is the function definition/declaration for `function getMovies(arr)` to which the parameter `arr` is passed. Within the body of the function, a request is made to the OMDB api:

```
request('https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=60f7bdd3&t=' + movies[i],
```
`movies[i]` refers to the movies array I create that is the value of the argument passed into `function getMovies(arr)`. Why `movies[i]`? Because the request is looped over since I am making a request to retrieve data for a ***number*** of movies, not just one:

```
const movies = ['saw', 'reds', 'titanic', 'the sting', 'scary movie', 'sunset boulevard', 'scream', 'rear window', 'all about eve', 'suspicion'];

function getMovies(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        request('https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=60f7bdd3&t=' + movies[i],
            function(err, response, body) {
                if (!err && response.statusCode === 200) {
                    movies[i] = JSON.parse(body);
                    const actors = JSON.parse(body)["Actors"];
                    const releaseDate = JSON.parse(body)["Released"];
                    const year = JSON.parse(body)["Year"];
                    const poster = JSON.parse(body)["Poster"];
                    console.log(releaseDate);
                    console.log(movies[i]);
                }
            })
    }
}
```
In order to retrieve data for an **indeterminate** number of movies greater than 1, I had to create a function I could call that encapsulates the request to the **OMDB** api, and parses the streamed data from it. Why does it have to be parsed? Because when data is received from a web server, the data is always a string. If the data is parsed with `JSON.parse()`, it becomes a **JavaScript object** which can then be used in the application. 

The if statement states that if there is **no error** and the **response status code** is equal to **200**, a successful request, then `movies[i]` equals the total parsed content returned from **OMDB**. Then, however, I had to grab the specific data I wanted.
